# Marko Pecic's Q3 Project 

## Project Details
* A project description
    * Possible Ideas
        * Fishermans tracking webapp User submits Lures used, fish caught, time spent on water, photos
* Who uses it?
    * Fishermen looking to use their data to improve their bites
* What outputs do they need?
    * 
* What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
    * User id
    * Location, Time, Date
    * Rod, Reel, Line
    * Lure used 
    * Photo of fishing location, catch, equipment 

* A list of technologies that you plan to use
    * React, React Router, Bootstrap, ReactStrap 
* A well-defined and written-out feature list
    * A user on log in will be able to dashboard of overall stats with number of trips, catches, time spent on water
    * A user will be able to group trips by location or linearly 
    * A user can upload photos, comments, and stats from trip 

    

## Agile Workflow

## Base Goals
* Must be full CRUD for at least one model (i.e. posts/comments/etc)
    * Login, Create, READ, EDIT, DELETE trips 
* Must contain server routes handling full CRUD.
    ## 
* Must use a front end framework (AngularJS, Angular5, React, Vue, etc.)
    * REACT
* Must use client side routing(ui-router, react-router v4, etc.)
    * REACT ROUTER
* Must contain parent/child components and pass data/functions down from parent component to child component somewhere
    * ...
* If any version of Angular/AngularJS is used, it must contain services.
    * NOT USED

## Stretch Goals

## STRETCH GOALS

* Use a state management library (Redux / Vuex / ngRx /etc.)
* Use Authentication (Login/Logout)
    * WILL HAVE USER LOGIN 
* Use some significant technology that was not covered in the program. This is not required, though. Examples include:
    * Using Ember, Angular 4, AngularJS, Vue, etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.6
* Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
* Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native Desktop](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
* Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
* Using Rails, .NET, SailsJS, or some other backend framework for building APIs

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your repositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio
