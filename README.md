# Q3 Project Requirements

The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use to:

* [Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor](#proposal)
* [Follow an agile development workflow](#agile)
* [Create and deploy a full-stack web app](#create-deploy)
* [Complete a write-up of the project](#write-up)
* [Add all three of these to an online portfolio](#portfolio)
* [Present your work to the class](#present)

## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

You will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
* Who uses it?
* What outputs do they need?
* What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out feature list

Fork this repository and submit a pull request with your proposal in the following format: <firstname>-<lastname>-q3-proposal.

## Follow Agile Workflow

* The methodologies, tools, and roles you use are up to you.

## Create and deploy a complete fullstack app

Your app should:

### BASE GOAL

* Must be full CRUD for at least one model (i.e. posts/comments/etc)
* Must contain server routes handling full CRUD.
* Must use a front end framework (AngularJS, Angular5, React, Vue, etc.)
* Must use client side routing(ui-router, react-router v4, etc.)
* Must contain parent/child components and pass data/functions down from parent component to child component somewhere
* If any version of Angular/AngularJS is used, it must contain services.

### STRETCH GOALS

* Use a state management library (Redux / Vuex / ngRx /etc.)
* Use Authentication (Login/Logout)
* Use some significant technology that was not covered in the program. This is not required, though. Examples include:
* Using Ember, Angular 4, AngularJS, Vue, etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.6
* Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
* Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native Desktop](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
* Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
* Using Rails, .NET, SailsJS, or some other backend framework for building APIs

#### OTHER REQUIREMENTS

* All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your repositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend 5 minutes presenting your work to the class using a video of the app being demoed.
* VIDEO IS REQUIRED

This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. **It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project**. Plan on spending extra time outside of class! This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your classmates and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
